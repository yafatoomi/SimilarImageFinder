# Image Similarity Finder

Image Similarity Finder is a **Streamlit-based web application** that identifies the top 5 visually similar images from a dataset to a user-uploaded query image. It leverages a **pre-trained VGG16 deep learning model** to extract image features and compute similarity using **cosine similarity**.

## Overview
This application is designed to find images visually similar to a user-provided query image. It downloads images from a CSV file containing URLs, extracts image features using a **VGG16 model**, and saves them for efficient similarity searches.

**Key Benefits**:
- Handles pre-uploaded datasets of images.
- Real-time upload and similarity comparison.
- Optimized to extract features only once for performance.

---

## Features
- **Image Downloading**: Automatically downloads images from a provided CSV containing image links.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features using the VGG16 model for dataset images.
- **Similarity Search**: Finds the top 5 most similar images to a user-uploaded query image.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Handles multiple uploads, displaying feature extraction status accordingly.

---

## Technologies Used
The project uses the following technologies and libraries:
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For using the pre-trained VGG16 deep learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface.
- **Pandas**: For handling CSV data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: For cosine similarity calculations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image handling and display.
- **Requests**: For downloading images from URLs.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - The app reads a CSV file containing image URLs and product IDs.
   - It downloads the images and saves them to a folder.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracts features from dataset images using the VGG16 model (without its top layer).
   - The extracted features are stored for efficient comparison.

3. **Query Image Upload**:
   - Users can upload a query image via the interface.
   - Features for the uploaded image are extracted dynamically.

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - The app calculates the cosine similarity between the query image's features and the dataset images.
   - The top 5 similar images are displayed on the interface.

## Application Walkthrough

### Initial View
When the app is run for the first time:
- It reads the dataset, downloads images, and extracts their features.
![Initial App View](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d097aaa7-fcf2-4883-acdf-c64a4694bce8)

- Once the features are successfully extracted, user can upload an image to find the top 5 similar images from the dataset.

### Query Image Upload
After uploading the query image, the app displays similar images from the dataset.

### Subsequent Query Image Upload
For subsequent uploads, the app skips redundant steps and displays similar images for the newly uploaded query.
